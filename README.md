# rust-arduino-sampler

A simple Arduino Sampler made with Rust.

It should:
- Read input from a midi device
- Map audio files to midi messages
- Play the audio file that matches the midi message received

## *EARLY DEVELOPMENT*
In this stage i'm focusing on core features. When everything's working on _AMD64_ we'll deviate to _AVR_ and _ARM64_.
